### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### Im a Python Developer
Currently, I'm deeply engrossed in the world of Python projects. My passion lies in crafting dynamic APIs, harnessing the power of Django to create robust web applications, and mastering the art of Automation Scripting. My toolkit includes a diverse range of libraries, such as BeautifulSoup4 (bs4) for efficient web scraping and Selenium for automating web interactions. Exploring these technologies not only ignites my curiosity but also fuels my drive to create innovative solutions. I'm excited to continue my journey in the realm of programming, continuously learning and pushing boundaries.

Skills: Python, SQL, C#

- Presently, I'm deeply immersed in a project I've named "Jarvis" â€“ a true embodiment of technological marvel. Jarvis is designed with multifaceted capabilities, effortlessly connecting to ChatGPT, seamlessly navigating Google Chrome, and skillfully conducting web scraping tasks, all through the magic of voice commands. Yet, the ambitions of Jarvis do not stop there. It's equipped with the prowess of Tesseract OCR, enabling it to unravel insights not only from text but also from images, pushing the boundaries of analysis. But that's not all â€“ Jarvis takes data security seriously. It boasts the ability to securely store tasks within a database, offering a repository of knowledge while ensuring the option to encrypt sensitive information whenever the need arises. With Jarvis, I'm not just creating a project; I'm crafting a visionary marvel that embodies the future possibilities of technology.
