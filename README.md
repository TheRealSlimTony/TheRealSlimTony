### Hi there!
#### I'm a Python Developer
Currently, I'm deeply engrossed in the world of Python projects. My passion lies in crafting dynamic APIs, harnessing the power of Django to create robust web applications, and mastering the art of Automation Scripting when necessary. My toolkit includes a diverse range of libraries, such as BeautifulSoup4 (bs4) for efficient web scraping and Selenium for automating web interactions. Exploring these technologies not only ignites my curiosity but also fuels my drive to create innovative solutions. I'm excited to continue my journey in the realm of programming, continuously learning and pushing boundaries.
