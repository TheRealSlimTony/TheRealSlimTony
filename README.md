### Hi there!
#### I'm a Python Developer
Currently, I'm deeply engrossed in the world of Python projects. My passion lies in crafting dynamic APIs, harnessing the power of Django to create robust web applications, and mastering the art of Automation Scripting when necessary. My toolkit includes a diverse range of libraries, such as BeautifulSoup4 (bs4) for efficient web scraping and Selenium for automating web interactions. Exploring these technologies not only ignites my curiosity but also fuels my drive to create innovative solutions. I'm excited to continue my journey in the realm of programming, continuously learning and pushing boundaries.

Skills: Python, SQL, C#, AZURE, js

### Sites that are currently deployed:

- [ShareSnippet](https://www.sharesnippet.com): ShareSnippet is a tool that aids in documenting useful snippets with high efficiency and privacy when needed. It features CRUD functionalities and an API with GPT-4 for documentation if necessary.
- [MyAI](https://myaiui.azurewebsites.net/): MyAI is an advanced interactive chatbot designed to elevate customer experience by employing sophisticated dialogue management. It leverages a deep understanding of user queries to deliver contextually relevant answers, utilizing a hybrid database system that combines vector search for rapid query handling and relational storage for transactional integrity. Architecturally, MyAI distinguishes between frontend and backend to optimize continuous integration and continuous deployment processes, enhancing security through robust measures like JWT authentication, encrypted session IDs, and securely hashed passwords.
- [Topics / random tests](https://topics-drc4.onrender.com/): Just ignore this; it's where I sometimes run proof of concepts that are already deployed in production.

### Published APIs:
- [CinepolisWebScrapper](https://cinepolisscrapper.azurewebsites.net/cartelera/) is a real-time scraper for Cinepolis schedules in Costa Rica, covering 3 cinemas (for now). The repository for this project is public!
